This is a repository containing my work on the seasonal Data Assimilation project.
It contains all the scripts (Jupyter Notebooks) and data used in the project and will be updated regularly.
Please reach out to me (n.j.de.winter@vu.nl) if you are interested in the project or want to use elements of it for your own work.
